# üíª My Dotfiles Setup

My custom setup for `bash`, `tmux`, `Fastfetch`, and `Starship` using `GNU Stow`.

## üöÄ Quick Start
```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/dotfiles-repo
cd ~/dotfiles-repo
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Install missing packages: stow, fzf, tmux, fastfetch, starship, zoxide.
    -  fastfetch ‚Üí installed via `.deb` (apt-compatible)
    -  starship ‚Üí installed via curl (binary to `~/.local/bin`)
    -  zoxide ‚Üí installed via curl (binary to `~/.local/bin`)
- Backup existing dotfiles (`.bashrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `Fastfetch` & `Starship` configs).
- Symlink dotfiles into your home directory via GNU Stow.
- Adds Fastfetch ASCII art to `~/ascii`.
- Update your `.bashrc` with:
    -  `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` so local binaries are picked up
    -  Initialization of Starship + Zoxide
    -  Conditional Fastfetch + tmux auto-start

### tmux Customizations

- Changed default prefix key from `Ctrl+b` to `` ` `` (backtick).
- Mouse support enabled for sanity.
- Scrollback increased to 10,000 lines (default 2,000).
- Vim key bindings enabled in scrollmode
- Pane borders customized (cool looking).
- 1-based indexing for windows and panes (default starts at 0).
- Minimalist status bar (cool looking).

## üîÑÔ∏è Undo Setup
To completely revert changes:
```bash
./undo.sh
```
The script will:
- Remove symlinks created by Stow.
- Restore backed-up configs (`.bashrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `Starship` & `Fastfetch` configs).
- Uninstall packages (unless you keep them):
    - Removes `fastfetch`, `tmux`, and `stow` via apt remove --purge.
    - Removes starship binary from `~/.local/bin`.
    - Removes zoxide binary from `~/.local/bin` and its manpages if present.
- Restart your shell (`exec bash`) so the clean `.bashrc` is loaded immediately.

### Keeping Installed Packages

If you only want to undo the symlinks and restore backups but keep installed packages, run:
```bash
./undo.sh --keep-installed-packages
# or the shorter alias
./undo.sh --keep-pkgs
```
This will:
- Restore backups and remove symlinks.
- Skip uninstalling apt packages, Starship, and Zoxide.
- Still restart your shell for a clean environment.

## üìù Notes
1. Starship and Zoxide are installed locally (`~/.local/bin`). If you want system-wide install, you can adjust the setup script.
2. If you run into `stow` warnings like:
    ```bash
    BUG in find_stowed_path? Absolute/relative mismatch ...
    ```
    it usually means Stow is crossing into Windows-mounted directories under WSL. This can be safely ignored if your dotfiles are working as expected.
